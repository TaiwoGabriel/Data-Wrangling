We are basically taking the latitudes and longitudes of all the locations in the news articles and mapping them to PRIO GRID latitudes and longitudes to get the corresponding Grid IDs of all the locations. At the end, we will have the Grid IDs to which the locations appearing in the news articles belong to. Then we will map these GRID IDs to indegenous data to find which of the found out PRIO GRID IDs are indegenous.\n",
